For this example, I signed in with the user credentials I configured in [osTicket System Administration Configuration](https://github.com/dtaylor15/osTicket-SystemAdmin-Config). I submitted a ticket as "Greg Universe" reporting an issue with his laptop's trackpad. Because Greg is registered on osTicket, he can view his ticket's progress and submission history.

### Ticket Assignment and Communication

Because Greg used a [SEV-A]() help topic his ticket was categorized as an emergency and went directly to the system administrator (me). After reviewing the ticket, I determined that this request was not an emergency. His trackpad issue did not severely impact business operations, especially because he is able to maintain productivity using his external mouse. I reduced this ticket's priority to a low, SEV-C plan. I also re-assigned it to Garnet, an agent on the Level 1 Support team. Each action taken was recorded on the ticket thread.
